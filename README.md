# car-ad-service
small project to play with functional design of a microservice.

## Problem Description
Car adverts should have the following fields:
* **id** (_required_): **int** or **guid**, choose whatever is more convenient for you;
* **title** (_required_): **string**, e.g. _"Audi A4 Avant"_;
* **fuel** (_required_): gasoline or diesel, use some type which could be extended in the future by adding additional fuel types;
* **price** (_required_): **integer**;
* **new** (_required_): **boolean**, indicates if car is new or used;
* **mileage** (_only for used cars_): **integer**;
* **first registration** (_only for used cars_): **date** without time.

Service should:
* have functionality to return list of all car adverts;
  * optional sorting by any field specified by query parameter, default sorting - by **id**;
* have functionality to return data for single car advert by id;
* have functionality to add car advert;
* have functionality to modify car advert by id;
* have functionality to delete car advert by id;
* have validation (see required fields and fields only for used cars);
* accept and return data in JSON format, use standard JSON date format for the **first registration** field.
